This project is a .NET 8 solution for Raspberry Pi 5 that provides an AP hotspot for WiFi configuration when the device is offline. It uses .NET IoT libraries to display a QR code on a connected screen, which links to a local web server for WiFi setup. After configuration, the system applies the settings and reboots to connect to WiFi.
